Note: For issues that are strictly related to the Command Line Interface (CLI), please post those on the [CLI repo](https://github.com/decentraland/cli).  For issues that are strictly related to the documentation, please post them on the [documentation repo](https://github.com/decentraland/documentation) or create a pull request suggesting a fix.
